# template
The template repository for each course.

Each course will have a repository of its own. <br>
In each repository, each semester of the course is represented as a directory. <br>
Note that the naming should have the following format: `<Fall/Spring><year>` with nothing between the season and year. <br>
**Note** If a course is offered by two different instructors in the same semester, add `-<ProfessorLastname>` to the name of the directory. <br>
For example: `Fall2023-Bahrak` <br>
In each directory, the documentation of each of the projects of the respective semester of the course is provided. <br>
Below is an example structure of a course repository:

```
Crypto-Currencies
├── Fall2022
│   ├── CA1
│   └── CA2
├── Fall2023
│   ├── CA1
│   ├── CA2
│   └── CA3
└── Spring2023
    ├── CA1
    └── CA2
```

Note that the naming of the project folders can be different based on the course (Some courses have a single CA with multiple phases etc.).

For writing the documentation of each project, please follow the [standard ReadMe](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme) style.
